# Kha-examples

This repo features a couple different base games. I'm favoring a minimalistic approach with most of these, though I'll revist them evetually to make them a bit more 'Object Oriented' someday. 

Right now each project is essentially a puzzle to see if I can make it as quick as I think I can. However, I think they could be useful for anyone that is trying to get a start in Kha, which has been liberatingly simple to work with. So, check them out, and see what you can learn and leverage.

Kha2d is in each of the games, so you won't need anything beyond Kha itself to get started (oh, and I'd suggest Kode Studio). If you have questions about anything, leave comments or hit me up @johndoughty6 on twitter!
